TODO:
* Go through the codeproject comments for "Embed an HTML control in your own window using plain C" and see if any of the bugreports/improvements apply to me too.
    * Same for the comments here: http://www.codeguru.com/Cpp/I-N/ieprogram/article.php/c4379
* Test key presses like Tab, Enter etc. Also test in google to make sure the suggest box drops down.
