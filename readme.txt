TODO:
* Go through the codeproject comments for "Embed an HTML control in your own window using plain C" and see if any of the bugreports/improvements apply to me too.
    * Same for the comments here: http://www.codeguru.com/Cpp/I-N/ieprogram/article.php/c4379
    * This one I have already fixed, but I would like to be able to verify that my fix works. http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.inetsdk.programming.webbrowser_ctl/browse_frm/thread/a1230f6e0e307cc4/984edb7c33fddaf2?lnk=gst&q=UI_GetExternal#984edb7c33fddaf2
* Test key presses like Tab, Enter etc. Also test in google to make sure the suggest box drops down.
